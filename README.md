<h3 align="center">AI Architect - Founder @ Aftermath Technologies - Offline Cognitive Systems Engineer</h3>

<p align="center">
  I build autonomous cognitive systems that run fully offline on regular hardware.  
  These are architectures where beliefs form ecologies - they compete, mutate, decay, and resolve contradictions over time.  
  Everything evolves through tension and evidence, with reinforcement learning guiding retrieval and agent coordination.  
  The goal is real understanding that grows from hard constraints, not from endless data or hidden tweaks.

### What I'm working on now

- Offline cognitive operating systems with persistent, evolving intelligence - belief tracking, contradiction resolution, anomaly detection, and immutable audit trails (`sentinel-os-core`)
- Adaptive belief ecologies where memory is dynamic but tamper-evident - beliefs live, conflict, mutate, and decay like organisms (`adaptive-belief-ecology-system`, `shadow-ecology`)
- Local RL-driven fusion of retrieval methods - combining RAG, graphs, and caches without any cloud (`rlfusion-orchestrator`)
- Multi-agent swarms with parallel execution, strict verification, and learned preferences that only advance when proven (`copilot-swarm-orchestrator`, `code-style-enforcer`)

All of these run on consumer machines, are heavily tested, and prioritize robustness, inspectability, and measurable progress over time.
