# Brad Kinnard
**AI Architect** | **Founder @ Aftermath Technologies** | **Offline Systems Engineer**

I build offline LLM systems, multi-agent workflows, and cognitive architectures that run on real hardware. With over 20 years of software engineering experience, including 18 years as a solo developer, my work bridges the gap between AI research and practical, local-first execution. I design AI that retains memory, traces contradictions, and runs autonomously without relying on cloud infrastructure.
