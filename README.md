Brad Kinnard - AI Architect & Systems Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an AI-focused engineer with over 15 years of experience in software development, specializing in offline AI ecosystems, belief ecology frameworks, swarm intelligence, and autonomous system design. My work revolves around building experimental prototypes that push the boundaries of cognitive modeling, anomaly detection, and secure, offline-first AI systems. As the founder of Aftermath Technologies, I take ideas from concept to working prototypes, combining tools and concepts in novel ways to solve complex problems.

What I Do: 
I design and experiment with AI systems that explore the edge of what's possible. My strength lies in orchestrating complex workflows, troubleshooting roadblocks, and deploying robust systems in real-world environments. 

My projects focus on:

Offline AI & Chatbots: Resilient, secure systems for zero-trust setups.
Belief Ecology & Contradiction Tracing: Frameworks for reasoning and anomaly detection.
Swarm Intelligence: Agent-based systems for autonomous coordination.
Multimodal Data Fusion: Experimental approaches to knowledge persistence and compression.

Key Projects:

Gravitational Data Attractor (GDA): A CPU-only AI system for multimodal data compression and fusion in latent space, designed for knowledge persistence and retrieval.
ContradictTraceAI: A prototype leveraging belief modeling to detect anomalies and adversarial data through contradiction tracing.
Sentinel OS Core: An offline-first AI operating layer with persistent memory and synthetic cognition for zero-trust environments.
Swarm Neural Refactoring Engine (SNRE): An experimental system for autonomous code refactoring using agent-based consensus and CI/CD integration.


Skills & Expertise:

Programming: Python (advanced), Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React.js, Next.js, WordPress
AI & ML: PyTorch, LangChain, Transformers, NLP, prompt engineering, generative AI, multimodal AI, anomaly detection
Systems & Tools: Linux (Ubuntu), Docker, Vercel API, Git, SQL/MySQL, Eclipse
Specialties: Cognitive computing, autonomous agents, edge AI, data compression, full-stack development

Current Goals:

Contribute to open-source AI projects like LangChain and Chatwoot.
Develop practical utilities for AI developers to evaluate LLM performance and drift.
Advance research in persistent, autonomous AI systems.
