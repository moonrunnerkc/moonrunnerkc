# Brad Kinnard · AI Architect & Systems Engineer

I build offline LLM systems, multi-agent workflows, and cognitive layers that run on real hardware instead of living in slide decks. Most of my work sits between research and practical tools: local first assistants, RL tuned retrieval, belief style memory systems, and code tools that try to behave consistently under real usage.

As the founder of Aftermath Technologies, I take ideas from sketch to working prototype, then push on them until they are stable enough for other people to run without babysitting.

## What I work on

- Offline LLM and agent systems on consumer GPUs and Linux  
- Multi-agent orchestration for code analysis, refactoring, and style enforcement  
- RL driven retrieval and fusion across RAG, cache, and graph sources  
- Belief ecology, contradiction tracing, and anomaly detection for long running sessions  
- WordPress and web infrastructure that actually stays online and pays bills

## What you will find here

Most repos fall into one of these buckets:

- Cognitive layer experiments  
  Belief ecologies, tension, memory decay, conflict tracking, and other ways of modeling what a system thinks it knows.

- RL and orchestration  
  Local first orchestrators, agent swarms, and RL tuned fusion layers that sit in front of LLMs instead of treating them like a magic box.

- Code tools  
  Multi-agent code style enforcement, refactoring helpers, and utilities that try to keep human codebases from turning into sludge.

- Infra and web  
  Pieces that support Linux based hosting, WordPress, and the glue that keeps small businesses online.

Most of this is experimental but runnable. If something is rough, I try to at least document what it is supposed to do and how to start it.

## Stack in use right now

**Core work**

- Python on Linux (Ubuntu)  
- Offline LLM orchestration, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning pipelines  
- Retrieval and fusion across RAG, cache, and graphs, with evaluation harnesses for drift and failure modes  
- Cognitive style layers: belief ecology, tension, contradiction tracing, long horizon sessions  

**AI and ML**

- PyTorch  
- LLM tooling and evaluation  
- Prompt and agent design  
- Anomaly detection and basic safety checks  
- Offline RL for policies and fusion weights  

**Systems and infra**

- FastAPI and async backends  
- Redis, SQL and MySQL  
- Docker, Git, basic observability and benchmarking  
- Local first, privacy focused setups that do not depend on a cloud crutch  

**Web and WordPress**

- WordPress, WooCommerce, custom themes and plugins  
- PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- Performance tuning, migrations, security hardening, DNS and SSL  

---

## What I am looking for

- Work on serious AI systems that have to be stable, explainable, and measurable  
- Roles where Python on Linux, offline LLMs, RL, and multi-agent orchestration are core to the job  
- Chances to turn the cognitive layer and belief ecology work into tools other people can run, inspect, and extend
